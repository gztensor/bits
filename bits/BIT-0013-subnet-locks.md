# BIT-0013: Stake locks

- **BIT Number:** 0013
- **Title:** Stake Locks
- **Author(s):** Greg Zaitsev
- **Discussions-to:** [URL for discussion thread]
- **Status:** Draft
- **Type:** Core
- **Created:** 2025-07-23
- **Updated:** 2025-07-23

**Note:** This BIT in fact tables the [PR #1860](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/pull/1860).

## üîç Abstract

This BIT proposes introduction of stake locks, where lock conviction will determine subnet ownership.

## üîß Motivation

There are some low quality subnets in the ecosystem, we can call them abandoned subnets. They are not actively managed by their owners and (1) are the source of attacks on the bittensor network because they can be occupied/taken over by malignant neurons, and (2) waste bittensor compute resource. One way to address the issue is allowing the subnet to be taken over by staking and locking a significant amount of TAO.

## üß™ Specification

- Change subnet owner based on subnet stake lock. Locks are linear with 100% being locked at the start block and 0% on the end block. Any staker can lock their stake. Approximately once per month (7200 * 30 blocks) the lock EMAs are recalculated and, if stake lock EMA is the highest for some account, it becomes the owner of the subnet.
- If stake is locked, then only unlocked portion of it can be unstaked at a given block.
- In order to prevent subnet sniping, the lock EMA is applied, which gives subnet owner enough warning to act.
- Conviction should also increase with higher lock duration (not implemented in reference impl).

### State maps

Additional state maps to handle the stake locks are:

```rust
/// ======================
/// ==== Stake locks =====
/// ======================
#[pallet::storage]
/// --- ITEM ( lock_interval_blocks ) | Stake lock EMA half-life factor
pub type LockIntervalBlocks<T: Config> =
    StorageValue<_, u64, ValueQuery, DefaultLockIntervalBlocks<T>>;

#[pallet::storage]
/// --- NMAP ( netuid, hot, cold ) --> stake_lock | Returns the stake_lock struct for netuid, hot and cold triplet.
pub type Locks<T: Config> = StorageNMap<
    _,
    (
        NMapKey<Blake2_128Concat, NetUid>, // subnet
        NMapKey<Identity, T::AccountId>,   // hot
        NMapKey<Identity, T::AccountId>,   // cold
    ),
    StakeLock,
    ValueQuery,
>;

#[pallet::storage]
/// --- NMAP ( netuid, hot, cold ) --> stake conviction ema | Returns the stake conviction EMA for netuid, hot and cold triplet.
pub type ConvictionEma<T: Config> = StorageNMap<
    _,
    (
        NMapKey<Identity, NetUid>,               // subnet
        NMapKey<Blake2_128Concat, T::AccountId>, // hot
        NMapKey<Blake2_128Concat, T::AccountId>, // cold
    ),
    AlphaCurrency,
    ValueQuery,
>;
```

### Extrinsic to lock stake

```rust
pub fn lock_stake(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    hotkey: T::AccountId,
    netuid: NetUid,
    duration: u64,

### Events

```rust
/// The new stake lock interval half-life factor was set
LockIntervalSet {
    /// New interval value (in blocks)
    new_interval: u64,
},

/// Stake lock has increased
LockIncreased {
    /// The owner coldkey of the stake
    coldkey: T::AccountId,
    /// The hotkey the stake is made to
    hotkey: T::AccountId,
    /// Subnet ID
    netuid: NetUid,
    /// Amount of alpha locked
    alpha_locked: AlphaCurrency,
},
```

### Additional check in remove_stake and all other extrinsics where stake is reduced

```rust
// Check stake locks
Self::check_locks_on_stake_reduction(
    origin_hotkey,
    origin_coldkey,
    origin_netuid,
    alpha_amount,
)?;
```

### Handling locks in swap coldkey

```rust
// 3. Swap Stake.
...

let stake_lock_old = Locks::<T>::get((netuid, &hotkey, old_coldkey));

...

// Merge locks
let stake_lock_new = Locks::<T>::get((netuid, &hotkey, new_coldkey));
let stake_lock_merged = StakeLock {
    alpha_locked: stake_lock_old
        .alpha_locked
        .saturating_add(stake_lock_new.alpha_locked),
    start_block: stake_lock_old.start_block.max(stake_lock_new.start_block),
    end_block: stake_lock_old.end_block.max(stake_lock_new.end_block),
};
Locks::<T>::insert((netuid, &hotkey, old_coldkey), stake_lock_merged);

// Remove old stake lock
Locks::<T>::remove((netuid, &hotkey, old_coldkey));
```

## üí¨ Discussion

- Consider support of the current owner (or any owner-to-be) by other keys, i.e. allow others to join their locks
- The appropriate minimum lock duration: It was made 1 day (7200 blocks) in the reference implementation, but probably needs to be longer.
